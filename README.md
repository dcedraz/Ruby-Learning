# Ruby-Learning
This repo is meant for keeping track of the study material I've been using to learn Ruby and Rails.

## Below is the content used for studying:

- [X] This [Learn-ruby course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby) from CodeAcademy. - :white_check_mark: Done in September 2021
- [X] This [Ruby on Rails video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg) from FreeCodeCamp - (codemy.com). :white_check_mark: Done in October 2021
- [ ] This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnCNJ5IYWFM) from Henrik Kniberg (Crip's Blog)

The video demonstrates:
- Iterative development with VERY fast feedback loop
- a dash of TDD
- continuous deployment via git & jenkins & cloudbees
- using eclipse tightly integrated with maven, jetty, and git.
- the basics of mongo DB
- the basics of java servlet development (I've intentionally avoided using web frameworks, as this setup will work for any web framework).

- [ ] Read book: Ruby on Rails Tutorial (Michael Hartl)
The book is a complete tutorial to learn Ruby on Rains from scratch.

- [ ] Ready book: Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship (Robert C. Martin)
- [ ] Look for knowledge about Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Unit testing, Cloudbees, Jetbrains. Basically how to program in a team.
- [ ] Check out local bootcamps:
- Academica do codigo
- Iron hack
- Le wagon
